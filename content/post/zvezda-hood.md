Italery kit from 1978, which explains strange **1/720** scale.

I've got Zvezda version just because it was a present. Interesting fact - Zvezda is not allowed to sell this kit outside of ex-USSR because it's just cheaper in it's version.

## Model quality

The kit is surprisingly good given it's age. It's pretty detailed, and the part quality is really nice.
The only thing that surprised me was total lack of decals.
And unfortunately some parts had gaps due to insufficient amount of plastic put into molds during the casting. Maybe just my kit's problems though.

## Build notes
The build is quite straightforward, the only fit issue I've got was with lower and upper halves of the hull.

It was the first model I've tried **Tamiya Flexible Masking Tape**, and it's a life saver for ship painting.
It makes painting waterline and deck sooo much easier.

I've drilled the gun barrels, and it was like the best 5 minutes spent on model. The difference is just fantastic:

Also I've decided to use photoetch for the first time. Got some **Tom's Modelworks** 1/700 railings, and while using PE is far more tedious than drilling the barrels, the result is quite rewarding and brings the model to the next level.

Before and after PE railings:

Added more PE on the superstructure, looks much better with it:

Had some spare PE inclined ladders from **Tom's Modelworks**, decided to replace plastic ones after quick comparison.

PE ladders vs plastic:

Spent whole weekend adding PE railings, I think the result is definitely worth it.

Fully assembled model, needs only matte coat and weathering:
