For some reason wooden kits keep attracting me more and more.
This one is the third I'm building, all from the same Russian company called [Master Korabel (Мастер Корабел)](http://master-korabel.ru/).

## St. Gabriel deck-boat
This was the main ship of the [First Kamchatka Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kamchatka_expedition) lead by Danish explorer [Vitus Bering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitus_Bering) for Russian Tsar Peter The Great in 1724-1730.

## Model quality
Just as with previous kits from this company I had no issues, so far everything is just awesome.

## Build notes

This kit is POB (planks on bulkheads), and it's hull is designed to be extremely rigid and sturdy.
Even by looking at the amount of bulkheads for stern and aft you can tell how thorough is the kit's design.

Once bulkheads were installed I proceeded with the first layer of planking:
