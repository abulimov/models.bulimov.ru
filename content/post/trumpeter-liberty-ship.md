## SS Jeremiah O'Brien
[SS Jeremiah O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Jeremiah_O%27Brien) is one of the few
surviving [Liberty Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ship) - cargo ships massively built by US in WW2.
Used everywhere - from arctic convoys to D-Day, those ships became a legend.

This particular ship is currently based in San Francisco where I had the pleasure to see and visit her.
Obviously after the visit I decided to build the model of this remarkable ship. I decided to go with 1/700 scale, mostly
because I already had [HMS Hood in ~1/700](/models/zvezda-hood), and it turned to be a huge mistake.
I didn't realize how tiny the model will be, and even went with adding Photo Etch set from **Tom's Modelworks**.

## Model quality
The quality is great, no flash, crisp details. PE set is also great, however instructions are very much hand-made and not lack details.

## Build notes

I was not intimidated by the teeny-tiny size of the model and was very much determined to build it as good as I could, with all possible details.
It was a rookie's mistake, and I pretty much burned out before I finished adding PE details to the superstructure.

To add to my misery when I painted the hull I realized that the paint I used was too dark, so I tried re-painting.
It didn't go well, so I tried to scrape the paint, but it only damaged the tiny details on the deck.

I gave up on the hull, but after investing so many hours in superstructure PE details I decided to buy a second model (luckily it costs only ~16 Euros) only for a hull.

However before second one arrived I stashed all the stuff that I built and left it for a looong looong time - more than a year and a half.
I simply couldn't bring myself to work on it again, and it sat in the corner of the shelf as a quite reminder of my mistakes.

Recently I saw same model finished on Reddit, and it gave me much needed incentive to work on the ship again.

Finishing the PE work was surprisingly easy (probably I've learned quite a lot since I last touched it), and even enjoyable to some extent.
However it's clear for me now that 1/700 **is not** my favourite scale to work with PE.

Then I quickly painted the (second) hull using much lighter grey colour (as in the first time I used **AK Interactive** paint sets for WW2 US Navy),
and to my relief it turned out to be not too bad, even with small imperfections and scratches.
This finally let me leave the mistakes I made with the model in the past, and gave confidence I can finish it.

**To be continued...**
