Ever since I was a passenger on one of this things thanks to Viking Splash Tours, I decided to build this model.
It's remarkable that truck/boat hybrid built 70 years ago is still able to move, and even sail.

As for the model, I've got Eduard PE kit for it, because I really enjoyed working with PE while building [HMS Hood](/models/zvezda-hood/),
and it adds so much to the look.

## Model quality

So far I've just looked at the sprues, everything looks nice and crisp.
PhotoEtch kit by Eduard is remarkably good though.

## Build notes

Built just cabin floor, looks fantastic with PE.
