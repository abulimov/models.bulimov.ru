Nice little model from **Battle of Britain: Ready For Battle** set.

The whole kit is fantastic - it's 'new tool', so perfect quality and level of details.
I've decided to start with truck just to get back to painting vehicles and try some new techniques.

## Model quality

It's perfect. Had zero problems with the kit, you have multiple options like open/closed bonnet, with or without tent, and so forth.
And the instructions are just great - everything is clear, all new parts in each step are highlighted with color. 

## Build notes
The build was straightforward, no fit issues at all.

I've started with base coat of A.MIG-044 Chipping paint, then a coat of MIG chipping fluid, and then Ammo Mig Khaki Green #3 (AMIG-113).

Here is the model before the actual chipping:

And here it is after I've wetted the surface and used old paintbrush to chip the Khaki coat:

It's my first time using chipping fluid, previous experiments with hairspray were a failure.
I'm very happy with the result, looks far better than I've ever hoped for.

Applied decals over gloss coat:
