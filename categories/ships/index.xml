      <description>Italery kit from 1978, which explains strange 1&amp;frasl;720 scale.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got Zvezda version just because it was a present. Interesting fact - Zvezda is not allowed to sell this kit outside of ex-USSR because it&amp;rsquo;s just cheaper in it&amp;rsquo;s version.
Model quality The kit is surprisingly good given it&amp;rsquo;s age. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty detailed, and the part quality is really nice. The only thing that surprised me was total lack of decals.</description>

      <description>Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and seen Hercules tug there, I knew I want to build something like it.
Quick research on scalemates.com showed that only reasonable option I had was this ancient Revell kit from 1979, so I had no choice but to build it.
Model quality As you might expect from a kit designed in 1955, the quality is bad by modern standards.</description>
