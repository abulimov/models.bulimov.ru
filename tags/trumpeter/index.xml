      <description>SS Jeremiah O&amp;rsquo;Brien SS Jeremiah O&amp;rsquo;Brien is one of the few surviving Liberty Ships - cargo ships massively built by US in WW2. Used everywhere - from arctic convoys to D-Day, those ships became a legend.
This particular ship is currently based in San Francisco where I had the pleasure to see and visit her. Obviously after the visit I decided to build the model of this remarkable ship. I decided to go with 1&amp;frasl;700 scale, mostly because I already had HMS Hood in ~1&amp;frasl;700, and it turned to be a huge mistake.</description>
