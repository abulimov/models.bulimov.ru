      <description>My first ever wooden kit, yay! I was always intimidated by wooden ship kits, assuming huge amount of scratch-building and crafting. Also I knew from my childhood plastic kit experience that rigging is quite challenging on Tall Ships.
Luckily nowadays thanks to modern technologies like laser cutters and CAD software wooden kits are enhanced with pre-shaped laser cut hull planks and details.
Considering this I decided to give it a try and build something relatively simple, relatively cheap and without complex rigging.</description>

      <description>This model attracted me because of it&amp;rsquo;s subject. This Tupolev I-4 plane is little known even amongst ex-USSR modellers despite being first Soviet all-metal fighter. And it&amp;rsquo;s a sesquiplane, which is also interesting to me.
Model quality If you think that nothing surprising here, because it&amp;rsquo;s old Zvezda, here comes the surprise - it&amp;rsquo;s actually not. It&amp;rsquo;s Zvezda making Encore Models kit from ninetieth. So the quality is even a bit worse then I expected.</description>

      <description>Another blast from the past.
Bought this model in 2010, just because I wanted to build some WW1 biplane. So it waited 6 years for me do find time and space to build it. Lucky for me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even start it in 2010 except for gluing two engine halves together, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t ruined and I had no problems with old paint.
Model quality I&amp;rsquo;ve built it right after BA-10, and the quality difference was drastic.</description>
